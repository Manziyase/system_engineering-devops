# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This project is part of the **ALX System Engineering - DevOps** track. It introduces key concepts related to shell initialization files, environment variables, local variables, and shell expansions.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- What happens when you type `$ ls -l *.txt`
- What are the different types of variables
- What is the difference between a local and a global variable
- How to create, update, and delete shell variables
- What is expansion and the different types (e.g., path name, variable name, arithmetic)
- How to use `alias` and when to use them
- How to perform arithmetic operations in the shell

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each file in this directory is a Bash script that performs a specific task related to shell variables and expansions:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-alias` | Creates an alias named `ls` with the value `rm *` |
| `1-hello_you` | Prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user |
| `2-path` | Adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory |
| `3-paths` | Counts the number of directories in the `PATH` |
| `4-global_variables` | Lists environment variables |
| `5-local_variables` | Lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions |
| `6-create_local_variable` | Creates a new local variable `BEST=School` |
| `7-create_global_variable` | Creates a new global variable `BEST=School` |
| `8-true_knowledge` | Prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` (environment variable) |
| `9-divide_and_rule` | Prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE` (environment variables) |
| `10-love_exponent_breath` | Displays the result of `BREATH` to the power `LOVE` |
| `11-binary_to_decimal` | Converts a binary number stored in `BINARY` to decimal |
| `12-combinations` | Prints all possible combinations of two letters except identical pairs |
| `13-print_float` | Prints a number with two decimal places, stored in the environment variable `NUM` |
